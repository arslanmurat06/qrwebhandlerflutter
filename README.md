# qrhandler for Flutter Web

Flutter WEB QR Generator and Downloader

I found qr generator from this <a href="https://kevmoo.github.io/qr.dart/">qrgenerator</a> (Thanks to him)
But you could not download.

There are many sample codes to generate qr code and download this generated code on mobile.
But on web downloading generated qr code is a little bit tricky.

I hope you find what you search.
